- Create Utils.js

Utils.js with latest Javascript ES6 syntax

Create the Utils.js file like this with multiple functions, etc

const someCommonValues = ['common', 'values'];
    
export const doSomethingWithInput = (theInput) => {
   //Do something with the input
   return theInput;
};
    
export const justAnAlert = () => {
   alert('hello');
};

Then in your components that you want to use the util functions, import the specific functions that are needed. You don't have to import everything

import {doSomethingWithInput, justAnAlert} from './path/to/Utils.js'

And then use these functions within the component like this:

justAnAlert();
<p>{doSomethingWithInput('hello')}</p>

- Also check to see if there is better file layout
